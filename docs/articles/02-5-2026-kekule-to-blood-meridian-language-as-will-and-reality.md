# Abstract

In the word, which certainly does exist, there is no set meaning. What is said can easily be what is not said, and the meaning of the word is, more or less, beholden only to those who may say or write it. In this paper we argue that language is incomplete as a modem of communication. We analyze Cormac McCarthy’s essay “The Kekulé Problem”, book “Blood Meridian”, and various other sources to define the physicality of language, by the description of the world, as an expression of the subconscious, and to model language as an expression of will rather than communication.
